# LLM as Thought-Partner

This site presents a set of working documents exploring the use of large language models as thought-partners in education. The central question: can an LLM be configured to deepen a student's understanding rather than replace their thinking?

The documents below approach this question from three angles: a demonstration, an analytical reflection, and a survey of the broader landscape.

## Documents

**[A Demonstration of Socratic AI Tutoring](transcript)**  
A transcript of a simulated tutoring session in which an AI companion guides a mathematics graduate through Principal Component Analysis. The session is unscripted and lightly edited. An epilogue reflects on what worked, what the boundary conditions were, and what the implications might be.

**[What Enables the Thought-Partner Stance?](stance)**  
A case study examining a specific moment in the transcript, in which the student spontaneously constructs a mathematical proof rather than accepting a claim on authority. The article proposes four factors that enabled this moment, develops a reframing of "productive struggle" as a resource-allocation problem rather than a moral imperative, and invites collaboration.

**[LLM-Enhanced Learning: A Thought-Partner Alternative](landscape)**  
A survey of the current landscape of LLM-based learning tools, diagnosing the structural incentives behind the default toward answer-provision. The paper proposes five pedagogical principles for a thought-partner alternative and describes an instantiation currently in alpha testing.

## Suggested Reading Order

The documents are self-contained, but readers coming to this work for the first time may find this sequence most useful:

1. **Transcript** first, to see the interaction in action.
2. **Stance article** next, for analysis of what the transcript reveals about pedagogy.
3. **Landscape paper** last, for the broader context and design principles.

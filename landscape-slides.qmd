## The Paradox

::: {.incremental}
- **BLS projections**: Data science jobs growing 35% through 2033
- **Meanwhile**: Entry-level hiring is *declining*
- **The shift**: Tasks that trained junior staff now assigned to AI
:::

. . .

**The bar has risen.** Graduates must demonstrate value *beyond* what AI provides.

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Set up the tension this audience feels daily.
:::

---

## Outline

1. **Landscape**: Where does LLM-assisted learning fit in a decades-old endeavor?

2. **Problem**: Why do tools default to answer-provision, and what does that cost?

3. **Alternative**: The thought-partner approach and its theoretical foundations

4. **Instantiation**: The EDA Companion—a proof of concept

5. **Implications**: What this means for educators and employers

::: {.notes}
20 seconds. Orient the audience to the structure.

## Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)
A Decades-Old Endeavor

::: {.incremental}
- **1960s**: Programmed instruction (Skinner), PLATO system
- **1970s-80s**: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)
- **1990s-2000s**: Adaptive learning, learning management systems
- **2010s**: MOOCs, personalized learning platforms
- **2020s**: LLM-based agents
:::

. . .

The question is not *whether* technology will be used for learning, but *how*.

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Establish that this is a continuing endeavor, not a new one. LLMs are the latest chapter.
:::

---

## The Current Landscape

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**K-12 & Professional**

- Khanmigo (Khan Academy)
- Kira Learning
- Skillsoft CAISY

*Guided discovery, adaptive pacing*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Coding & General**

- GitHub Copilot
- CS50 Duck (Harvard)
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

*Productivity-focused or pedagogically neutral*
:::
:::

. . .

Most tools optimize for **user satisfaction**, which gets conflated with **answer-provision**.

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Acknowledge the landscape without dwelling on details.
:::

---

## What's Missing

::: {.incremental}
- K-12 tools assume younger learners; scaffolding may be excessive for adults
- Professional tools focus on soft skills, not technical/conceptual mastery
- Coding tools prioritize efficiency over understanding
- General LLMs require the learner to impose discipline—most won't
:::

. . .

**Underserved**: Adult learners in technical domains who need conceptual depth, not just answers.

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Name the gap that motivates the thought-partner approach.
:::

---

## Why Tools Default to Answers

::: {.incremental}
- User satisfaction metrics reward speed and perceived helpfulness
- "Correct answer" is easier to evaluate than "productive struggle"
- Commercial pressure: users want to feel helped, not challenged
- LLM training optimizes for helpfulness → conflated with answer-provision
:::

. . .

The incentives are aligned against deep understanding.

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Explain the structural problem—not malice, but misaligned incentives.
:::

---

## Consequences for Learning

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What students get:**

- Fast answers
- Completed assignments
- Illusion of competence
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What students lose:**

- Productive struggle
- Durable understanding
- Ability to work without the tool
:::
:::

. . .

Can the graduate who used Copilot for every assignment debug independently?

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Make the stakes concrete.
:::

---

## The Design Tension

LLMs are *capable* of providing answers instantly.

Users *want* answers instantly.

. . .

Any pedagogical approach must work against:

- The tool's default behavior
- The user's immediate aims

...in service of the learner's **long-term interests**.

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Frame the core challenge before presenting the solution.
:::

---

## Theoretical Foundations

::: {.incremental}
- **Dewey & Piaget**: Constructivism—understanding is *built* by the learner, not *received*
- **Vygotsky**: Thinking originates in dialogue; articulation is constitutive of understanding
- **Greeno**: Cognition is situated across people, tools, and environments
:::

. . .

An AI that elicits explanation may support deeper understanding than one that provides answers—because the cognitive work of construction and articulation is where learning happens.

::: {.notes}
60 seconds. Ground the approach in established theory. These aren't new ideas—LLMs are a new context.
:::

---

## The Thought-Partner Premise

Not a tutor who knows the answer and leads you to it.

A **partner** who helps you think, and refrains from thinking for you.

. . .

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
"Socratic tutoring is a technique. Thought-partnership is a relationship."
:::

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Establish the distinction clearly.
:::

---

## Principle 1: Human Accountability

The student remains responsible for all conclusions and decisions.

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- The Companion asks questions, surfaces considerations, identifies gaps
- The student synthesizes and decides
- If asked "what's the answer?", redirect to "what's your current thinking?"
:::

. . .

**The student is the author.**

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Emphasize that the Companion does not produce work the student submits.
:::

---

## Principle 2: Student as Teacher

The student demonstrates understanding by explaining concepts to the Companion.

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- "How would you help a friend understand clustering?"
- The Companion probes for clarity, coherence, completeness
- Gaps become visible through the act of articulation
:::

. . .

**Explaining forces organization of thought.**

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. This operationalizes Vygotsky—articulation as constitutive of understanding.
:::

---

## Principle 3: Deliberate Skepticism

The Companion questions assumptions, asks for evidence, avoids premature validation.

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Rather than "that's right!", ask "how do you know?"
- "What would change your mind?"
- Model the internal dialogue of expert practitioners
:::

. . .

**Build habits of intellectual rigor.**

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. This is where the Companion differs most from typical assistants.
:::

---

## Principle 4: Facilitated Autonomy

The Companion provides minimal scaffolding necessary for progress, then withdraws.

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Hints before answers
- Questions before hints
- Silence before questions (when productive)
:::

. . .

**Struggle is where learning happens; premature rescue short-circuits the process.**

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Connects to Bjork's "desirable difficulties" and Kapur's "productive failure."
:::

---

## Principle 5: Transparent Process

The Companion makes its pedagogical approach visible.

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Student-Companion conversations as thinking out loud
- Invite reflection on the learning process itself
- Build metacognitive awareness
:::

. . .

**Supports transfer to contexts without Companion support.**

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Students should understand why the Companion behaves as it does.
:::

---

## How This Differs

| Dimension | Typical Agent | Thought-Partner |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Default response | Provide answer | Ask clarifying question |
| Success metric | Task completion | Demonstrated understanding |
| Scaffolding | Maximize support | Minimize support |
| Student role | Recipient | Active constructor |
| Transparency | Hidden pedagogy | Explicit pedagogy |

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Let the table speak; don't read it aloud.

## EDA Companion: Context

A pedagogical agent for *Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning*

::: {.incremental}
- Master's-level textbook bridging 
  + R4DS: _R for Data Science_ 
  + ISLR: _Intro to Statistical Learning_
- Target: aspiring data scientists with varying preparation
- Focus: geometric intuition, not just procedures
:::

. . .

Book: [tthrall.github.io/eda4ml](https://tthrall.github.io/eda4ml/)

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Brief context—the Companion is an instantiation, not the main point.
:::

---

## EDA Companion: Status

::: {.incremental}
- **System prompt** embeds the five principles as behavioral constraints
- **Alpha testing** with two subjects (February 2026)
- **Data collection**: post-session surveys, conversation logs
- **Focus**: pedagogical quality, independent of coding workflow
:::

. . .

Demo transcript: [tthrall.github.io/llm-thought-partner](https://tthrall.github.io/llm-thought-partner/)

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. Honest about early stage.
:::

## Implications

**For educators**: Move beyond "ban or allow" → shape the interaction

**For curriculum**: Assignments should emphasize process, not just product

**For employers**: Upskilling tools should build capability, not dependency

. . .

**For this community**: Promote cultivation of tool-fluency _and_ critical thinking

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Connect to the Summit audience's concerns.
:::

---

## Help Needed

::: {.incremental}
- **Conversational stance**: How do we help students engage the Companion as 
  a tool for thinking out loud—surfacing their own reasoning—rather than 
  as an answer-provider? Is "deliberate role-play with a classmate" a useful frame?
- **LLM limitations awareness**: How do we cultivate appropriate skepticism 
  without undermining the Companion's utility as a dialogue partner?
- **Cross-session continuity**: What mechanisms should the Companion use to 
  retain knowledge of content scope, learning preferences, and student progress?
- **Progress visibility**: How might we share the record of a student's 
  learning journey in ways that support self-reflection and communication 
  with instructors?
:::

. . .

These are design questions where educator perspectives would be invaluable.

::: {.notes}
45 seconds. Genuine invitation for input—these are open questions, not rhetorical.
:::

---

## The Challenge

How do we prepare graduates who add value **with** AI—not despite it?

. . .

The thought-partner approach is one possible answer.

::: {.notes}
30 seconds. End with the question that invites discussion.
